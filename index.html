	<h3>Bharat Bazaar</h3>
	<h4>ABOUT OUR FLAGSHIP BRAND</h4>
	<p>Bharat Bazaar is the brainchild of Mr. Vikas Makhija, the CEO & Managing Director of Tapovan Impex Private Limited (TIPL). The idea of manufacturing and dealing in spices was passed on to him from his late great grandfather, who traded in a wide variety of spices in the early 1900s. With an aim of carrying forward this legacy, Mr. Vikas initiated the sales of spices yet again by launching them under his very own brand ‘Bharat Bazaar’ also called ‘BB’ in 2005. The in-house produced spices are now sold under the brand name BB, with red chili powder being the brand’s specialty. These spices are manufactured in-house with par excellent hygiene and GM practices along with necessary laboratory tests. The product line now includes bakery items, festival products and kitchenware items.</p>
